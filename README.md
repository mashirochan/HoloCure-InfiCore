# HoloCure Infi Core Mod
A HoloCure core mod that adds in-game mod enabling/disabling, config editing, and more!

 Note: this is a **CORE MOD** that all of my other mods depend on. **If you install my other mods, you will need this one.**

# Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems you could have that are preventing your mod from not working correctly:

### "Play Game" Does Not Open Game

Depending on when you are reading this, there is currently a bug in Aurie Manager where the "Play Game" button is a bit finicky.. You should be able to just start the game through Steam or however you usually start it up. Odds are that this will be fixed very soon and this troubleshooting will become irrelevant!
