# HoloCure Infi Core Mod
A HoloCure core mod that adds in-game mod enabling/disabling, config editing, and more!

 Note: this is a **CORE MOD** that all of my other mods depend on. **If you install my other mods, you will need this one.**

# Installation

Regarding the YYToolkit Launcher:

It's a launcher used to inject .dlls, so most anti-virus will be quick to flag it with Trojan-like behavior because of a similar use-case. The launcher is entirely open source (as is YYToolkit itself, the backbone of the project), so you're more than welcome to build everything yourself from the source: https://github.com/Archie-osu/YYToolkit/

- Download the .dll file from the latest release of my [Infi Core mod](https://github.com/mashirochan/HoloCure-InfiCore/releases/latest)
- Download `Launcher.exe` from the [latest release of YYToolkit](https://github.com/Archie-osu/YYToolkit/releases/latest)
  - Place the `Launcher.exe` file anywhere you want for convenient access
- Open the folder your `HoloCure.exe` is in
  - Back up your game and save data while you're here!
  - Delete, rename, or move `steam_api64.dll` and `Steamworks_x64.dll` if you're on Steam
- Run the `Launcher.exe`
  - Click "Select" next to the Runner field
    - Select your `HoloCure.exe` (wherever it is)
  - Click "Open plugin folder" near the bottom right
    - This should create and open the `autoexec` folder wherever your `HoloCure.exe` is
    - Move or copy your `infi-core-vX.X.X.dll` file into this folder
  - Click "Start process"
    - Hope with all your might that it works!

Not much testing at all has gone into this, so I'm really sorry if this doesn't work. Use at your own risk!

# Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems you could have that are preventing your mod from not working correctly:

### YYToolkit Launcher Hangs on "Waiting for game..."
![Waiting for game...](https://i.imgur.com/DxDjOGz.png)

The most likely scenario for this is that you did not delete, rename, or move the `steam_api64.dll` and `Steamworks_x64.dll` files in whatever directory the `HoloCure.exe` that you want to mod is in.

### Failed to install plugin: infi-core.dll
![Failed to install plugin](https://i.imgur.com/fcg1WWe.png)

The most likely scenario for this is that you tried to click "Add plugin" before "Open plugin folder", so the YYToolkit launcher has not created an `autoexec` folder yet. To solve this, either click "Open plugin folder" to create an `autoexec` folder automatically, or create one manually in the same directory as your `HoloCure.exe` file.
